Title: Death and Dancing
Format: eBook
Author: Claire  Dowie ; Claire  Dowie 
Place: London
Publisher: Bloomsbury
Year: 2013
Abstract: In a spiky, angry duologue between 'She' and 'He', Dowie interrogates the labels with which society constricts everyone - gay, lesbian, straight, man, woman. 'He' has come over from America to study at a London University, and is out and proud, but he might fancy 'She' a bit. Particularly when 'She' is wearing a leather jacket, and making him wear a dress, because 'She' is determined to be anything she wanted to be, and wants to show him that you don't have to be feminine or be masculine or wear a costume or buy a suit. 'Death and Dancing' is about two people going dancing and the social categories of sexuality which try to pin them down. It was first presented in 1992 in Honolulu, Hawaii
